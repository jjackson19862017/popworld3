# Pop World

For my Fourth and Final Milestone Project have chosen to build a project based on an auction website involving Pop!Vinyl's.  The goal of the website is for the Owner to advertise his Pop!Vinyl collection and sell them to the public involving either bidding for items or buying them out-right.

I will set up an authentication and authorisation.  Where only registered users can bid and buy items that are up for auction.

When the buyers come to purchase their goods, they will be using the Stripe Payment Method.

## Project Brief

- Earn money on selling the artifacts (the site owner is the seller)

- Create an online store focused on selling unique historical artifacts, such as The Holy Grail to the highest bidder.

- Allow users to search for artifacts based on various fields.

- Allow users to see the price, image and other basic details about an artifact.

- Users would be able to learn about the historical details of each artifact, the culture it came from, the way it was created and its journey across different owners in the past.

For example, you might want to include information about "events" that took place in the past and that one or more artifacts took place in, or originated from.

- Allow users to bid on items, or pay a higher price to purchase them immediately. Users have to be registered for this.

### Advanced potential feature (nice-to-have)

Allow registered users to write reviews about the artifacts, only if they purchased them.

Expand the search functionality to allow users to sort results based on price, age and other parameters in both ascending and descending order.

Include pagination and/or other dynamic display actions using javascript.

Use javascript polling to update the page whenever there's a new bid.

### Wednesday 11th March 2020

    'makemigrate' --> my terminal shortcut for making migrations
    'migrate' --> my terminal shortcut for migrating

- Created Bids App

    This is where the Bids will be created and held within the Auctions.

    'makemigrate' --> my terminal shortcut for making migrations
    'migrate' --> my terminal shortcut for migrating

- Created Users App

    This is where Users will be created so that they can have access to the Auctions and make a bid.

    'makemigrate' --> my terminal shortcut for making migrations
    'migrate' --> my terminal shortcut for migrating

- Test - Tried to add a user in the user accounts, it failed stating that an integer was required instead of a string.  Maybe I should create a form where the id is inserted as an integer instead of going through the admin page?

- Test - Created User, however it wont create a copy in the User Profile Table.  Must be to do with the Views.py

- 6 Hours LATER,
    After repeated attempts at trying to link to models together and then wondering why I was getting
    "'User' object has no attribute 'UserProfile'"

    I deleted my database at least a dozen times while trying to get rid of all the test data I was sending to it.

    I did the only sane thing anyone would do and goto Youtube.
    <https://youtu.be/Tja4I_rgspI>

    Turns out I had created a users app, when I didn't need to so I deleted the app, and my database again.  Then followed through the Video.

- Test - Created User, PASSED :-)

- Updated Profile page, after struggling with the form.  I thought I would complete the profile page for users.

- Need to design a way for Owner to Add Products
    base.html - modified.

### Thursday 12th March 2020

- Another 6 Hours later, I have managed to allow the owner to add products.
    But they cant at the moment have images,
    And there are duplicates.

- Messed up my Migrations file so I'm going to start again, from the beginning.

## STARTED PROJECT AGAIN

I have used some code from my old project found here at <https://github.com/jjackson19862017/PopWorld>
To save time I will use code from previous attempt, however will do everything from scratch.

- 30 Minutes Later
    I have got back to where I want with my Project.

- Test - Add Product from Admin section, works with the image.
- Test - Add Product from form post, fails.
    Im still thinking that its the form/model ????

- Will have to wait for tutor support on a screen sharing session as it still wont work.

- I have had a few poeple trying to help me on slack and tutor support, so thank you to Haley, Kitty, Jo and Feddie.

- Its been 3 hours no with no sucecss so I will move on to the next bit and hopefully come back to this later.

- Started working on the Auctions and Bids, and Kitty came back and said I should look at the images not being stored.  Turns out I'd missed a / off the upload_to images/        HAPPY DAYS

- Done my models, for the auctions and bids, did them together as they are in a way linked.  
Took me a while to get everything working, many attempts to get it working.  At least im getting better with the views.py files now.  That seems to be where my troubles lie.  I have setup the auctions in Admin, however I will now try to do what I did with my products for the owner and setup it on the HTML side.  Wish me luck.

- Done, didn't take me as long as I thought, used my owners products forms, models and view to save time.  Will come back to this later as I have a few ideas to improve UX.

- Time to look at doing the finishing of the auction or instant buys

- While building the html for the bid.html, I discovered that in my excitement of adding the user auction form.  It doesn't setup properly like it should do with the Admin side.

- I have the information displayed on the bid.html, as much as I could so I will now create the Checkout app

- Created checkout app and its files that go with the app, I also updated the settings.py file and the url.py

### Monday 16th March 2020

- Wished I could of continued this over the weekend however issues at work kept me from this.

- Watchthe the ECommenrce Videos from Code Institute to get my head around checking out for customers.

- I have made the cart app, but I have called it checkout, because I am not dealing with multiple quantities.  Just single purchases.

- Test - I tried "Ich" and nothing came up but empty box, so it was right about the number of products, however no information came up.

- I changed the views.py in search and it works.

- Test - I tried "Ich" and the details as expected turned up.
- Test - I tried "Ble" and the details as expected turned up.
- Test - I tried "Ren" and the details as expected turned up.

- Looks like the next video is search so looks like I will start that next bit.

- Completed the search video and can search from products, I will expand on the search features in future revisions.  Just need to get all the back end sorted first.

- Stripe is next, so I have updated the settings.py and env.py.

- I am now watching the video for Checkout, but I already have a checkout app.  So I will and try and merge things together.  Fingers crossed.

- Watched the videos from Code Institute and did my checkout, gonna upload to GitHub and call it a night.  Will sort any issues out in the morning and write a plan of action for what I need to do, to complete the project.

### Tuesday 17th March 2020

- Just found out, that my work holiday that I planned to have and complete this project has been cancelled due to the COVID19.  So I don't know if I will be able to finish this or not in time for the deadline at the end of the month.

- Finished watching the videos and doing the code, lets see if my on the fly modifications work.

## Things to do

### Backend

- Search for
    Characters
    Series
    Price

- Payment for Auctions

- Payment for Buy Now Items

- Only Showing Open Auctions

### Frontend

- Html for all the site
- Css
- JS

### Deployment

- Heroku
- Travis

### Testing

- Testing

- Added the ability to pay on my bid.html

- Cant get my bids to talk to my payment properly, might have to go back and start again.

## STARTED PROJECT YET AGAIN

To save time I will copy all my files up until the bid app, this includes all my settings, hidden files etc.

So from the TOP

I have created a project called "popworld"

Copied over the Static, Templates, Media Directories and the eny.py and .gitignore

I copied over the settings.py but removed some of the installed apps.

I have created the following apps "accounts", "home", and "products", I will copy over my previous versions.

Time to Migrate

Created Superuser

Working so far -> Pushed to github -> "Working Blank"

- I have updated the products.models, so that we only sell three types of series.

- New Idea, I will do the buy now items first, then work on the Auction part later.

- So I have watched the Code Institute Video again, and added a the option to buy either one or more products.
